# Object-Oriented Programming in Java

This repository contains my lab exercises and projects completed during the master's degree course on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java at ENSET Mohammedia.

## Labs

Here are the labs I've completed so far:

### [Lab 1: Arrays and Strings](TP1)
* Implemented various programs for array and string manipulation in Java
* Applied fundamental string operations and array algorithms

### [Lab 2: Inheritance, Overriding, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes and Interfaces](TP2)
* Developed a library management system using OOP principles
* Practiced inheritance hierarchies, method overriding, and interface implementation

### [Lab 3: Exception Handling](TP3)
* Created custom exception classes for different scenarios
* Implemented robust error handling using try-catch blocks

### [Lab 4: Java Collections and Streams](TP4)
* Implemented various exercises demonstrating the use of Java Collections and Streams
* Practiced operations on lists, maps, and sets
* Applied stream operations for data manipulation and processing

### [Lab 5: MySQL JDBC Connection and JavaFX](TP5)
* Established a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC
* Developed a JavaFX application for managing database records
* Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with JavaFX UI

### [Lab 6: Generics and I/O Operations](TP6)
* Implemented a Java program to simulate the 'ls' command for file system exploration
* Created a phone directory management system using file I/O operations
* Developed a generic interface and implementations for managing Products and Clients with serialization
* Applied file handling, generics, and object-oriented principles in practical scenarios

### [Lab 7: Java Multithreading](TP7)
* Implemented concurrent number printing using multiple threads
* Created a parallel sum calculation system that divides and processes numbers across threads
* Demonstrated thread creation, execution, and synchronization concepts
* Applied practical multithreading principles in Java applications

*I'll be adding more lab solutions as I complete them throughout the course.*

## Getting Started

If you'd like to explore my solutions, you'll need Java and an IDE (I recommend IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtmaneTouhami/poo-java.git
```

Each lab folder contains the solution code along with my notes and explanations.

## Conclusion

This repository documents my journey learning Object-Oriented Programming in Java. Through these labs, I've gained hands-on experience with fundamental programming concepts and advanced OOP principles. While these are my personal solutions, I hope they can be helpful to other students studying Java and OOP. Feel free to explore the code, but remember that learning comes from solving problems yourself!

## Contributing

If you're a fellow student and spot any improvements or alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to learning better ways to solve these problems. However, if you're currently taking the course, I encourage you to try solving the labs on your own first before looking at others' solutions.
