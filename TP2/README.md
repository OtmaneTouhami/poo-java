# Object-Oriented Programming in Java - Practical Exercises

This folder contains a set of practical exercises aimed at exploring and implementing key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using Java. Each exercise demonstrates different principles of OOP, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and class associations. These exercises are designed to deepen understanding and application of OOP in a structured, modular, and scalable manner.

## Exercises

### [Exercise 1: Library Management with Inheritance and Method Overriding](Exercice1/README.md)
This exercise focuses on building a library management application that applies concepts like inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation. It includes classes for managing information on library members, authors, and books, illustrating the relationships and modular structure within an OOP framework.

### [Exercise 2: Employee Salary Management with Abstract Classes and Polymorphism](Exercice2/README.md)
This exercise models an employee management application that categorizes employees (e.g., engineers and managers) and calculates their salaries according to their role. This exercise uses abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to handle salary computations based on employee type.

### [Exercise 3: Order Management System for Computers with Class Associations and Composition](Exercice3/README.md)
This exercise designs an order management system for a company selling computers. It employs principles of class association, composition, and encapsulation to represent the relationships between clients, orders, computers, and order lines.

### [Exercise 4: Product Management System with Interface and Implementation](Exercice4/README.md)
In this exercise, we create a product management system that employs an interface to define basic operations for managing products, separating the definition of operations from their implementation to ensure flexibility.
